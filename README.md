# 📊 Financial Growth Chatbot

This **Financial Growth Chatbot** is a Python-based application that provides interactive access to financial data for major tech companies like **Apple**, **Tesla**, and **Microsoft**. It allows users to query revenue, income, assets, liabilities, and cash flow across multiple years using **natural language questions**.

## 📦 Dependencies

- Python 3.6+
- pandas
- Standard Python libraries (`os`, `re`, `difflib`, etc.)

## 👨‍💻 Author Note

> This was my **first ever project**. Some basic features may be missing, which I will be improving in future updates.  
> I have taken help from **Python Documentation**, **YouTube**, **Forage**, **ChatGPT**, **DeepSeek** and **Other websites**.  
> The financial data is based on analysis of **10-K documents** submitted by these companies over the past 3 years. 😊

## 🚀 Future Goals

1. **GUI**: Add a user-friendly graphical interface and package the project as a standalone `.exe` application.
2. **Custom Files**: Allow users to upload their own CSV files in the expected format and analyze various datasets dynamically.

## 📝 Note

This chatbot is designed as a fully **integrated** Python application. All helper functions are embedded within the main script to eliminate external dependencies. You can extend its functionality by adding new columns to the CSV file or enhancing the parsing logic for better natural language understanding.
